REMINDER FROM LECTURE:
I recommend NOT mucking about with the .env file for this problem. Instead I recommend copying the firebase code right from google.


* Moved to firebasev8 instead of firebase v9: 
    
    ```
    npm uninstall firebase
    npm install firebase@8
    ```


## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
